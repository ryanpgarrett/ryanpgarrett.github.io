Today I made a new page! That's right, learned how to cut, copy, and paste like a pro. haha. 

Btw, most of my posts will keep all this jekyll info at the bottom because when I was first starting out as a developer, I never knew where to start. So by keeping this info I feel like someone out there might appreciate that information. It's just a blog anyways :P
