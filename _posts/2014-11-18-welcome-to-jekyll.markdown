So I decided to dive into jekyll and see where it takes me. Let's get started.

First I must say that installing jekyll is extremely easy. `At least on a mac, not quite so sure with windows yet.` Oh that's cool, just by simply adding a `tilde` I can highlight stuff!

Anyway, I wont go into the how to's and what-not, I'll save that for another post down the road, for now I just want to say that I conclude my first test post.



Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
