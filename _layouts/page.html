      My name is Ryan Garrett. I began playing around with html code back in the angelfire and geocities days. (Those terrible under construction gifs lol). Here's a link to the those who want to be reminded.<br><br>
      
     <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/underconstruction/">Blast to the past</a> <br><br>
      
      At any rate it wasn't long before <a href="www.2advanced.com">2advanced</a> caught my eye. I've been following them ever since.<br><br>
      
      I have experience using HTML, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (previously known as ecmascript for you guys who want to reseach it), and jquery.<br><br>
      
      I am also familiar with Bootstrap, Foundation, Wordpress (yuck tbh) and some others (like jekyll).<br><br>
      
      If you are still reading and want more, head to the homepage and check out some of my articles. You may also feel free to send me questions, comments, or concerns <a href="contact.html">here.</a><br><br><br><br>
